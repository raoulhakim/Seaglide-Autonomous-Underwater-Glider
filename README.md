Seaglide operates as an autonomous underwater buoyancy glider, functioning without a tether or propeller, and consumes minimal energy. Its movement is based on altering pitch and buoyancy, typically achieved by intake or expulsion of water. This shift in buoyancy prompts the glider's ascent or descent in water. Simultaneously, as the glider changes pitch and maneuvers vertically, its wings produce lift, propelling it forward through the water.
